Sheldon Lee Cooper,[4] Ph.D., Sc.D.,
 is a fictional character in the CBS 
television series The Big Bang Theory, 
portrayed by actor Jim Parsons. For 
his
 portrayal, Parsons has won four
 Primetime Emmy Awards, 
a Golden Globe Award, a TCA Award,
 and two Critics' Choice Television 
Awards.
Sheldon is a theoretical physicist 
at Caltech who shares an apartment
 with his
 colleague and best friend, Leonard
 Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki). He
 is a former 
child prodigy with genius level 
IQ, but displays an almost total 
lack of social 
skills, a tenuous understanding of 
humor, and difficulty recognizing 
irony and 
sarcasm in other people, although 
he himself often employs them. He
 exhibits highly 
idiosyncratic and narcissistic 
behavior and a general lack of
 humility or empathy. 
These characteristics provide 
the majority of the humor involving 
him, which has
 caused him to be described as 
the show's breakout character.
[5][6][7][8] Despite s
peculation that Sheldon's personality
 traits may be consistent with Asperger 
syndrome, 
obsessive¨Ccompulsive personality 
disorder and asexuality,[7][9] c
o-creator Bill Prady 
has repeatedly stated that Sheldon's 
character was neither conceived nor 
developed with 
regard to any of these traits.[9]
